  abstract   = {We propose a non-iterative solution to the P n P problem--the estimation of the pose of a calibrated camera from n 3D-to-2D point correspondences--whose computational complexity grows linearly with n . This is in contrast to state-of-the-art methods that are O ( n 5) or even O ( n 8), without being more accurate. Our method is applicable for all n 4 and handles properly both planar and non-planar configurations. Our central idea is to express the n 3D points as a weighted sum of four virtual control points. The problem then reduces to estimating the coordinates of these control points in the camera referential, which can be done in O ( n ) time by expressing these coordinates as weighted sum of the eigenvectors of a 12 12 matrix and solving a small constant number of quadratic equations to pick the right weights. Furthermore, if maximal precision is required, the output of the closed-form solution can be used to initialize a Gauss-Newton scheme, which improves accuracy with negligible amount of additional time. The advantages of our method are demonstrated by thorough testing on both synthetic and real-data.},

  abstract       = {A dialytic-elimination and Newton-iteration based quasi-analytic inverse kinematics approach is proposed for the 6 degree of freedom (DOF) active slave manipulator in the Da Vinci surgical robot and other similar systems. First, the transformation matrix-based inverse kinematics model is derived; then, its high-dimensional nonlinear equations are transformed to a high-order nonlinear equation with only one unknown variable by using the dialytic elimination with a unitary matrix. Finally, the quasi-analytic solution is eventually obtained by the Newton iteration method. Simulations are conducted, and the result show that the proposed quasi-analytic approach has advantages in terms of accuracy (error < 0.00004 degree (or mm)), solution speed (<20 ms) and is barely affected by the singularity during intermediate calculations, which proves that the approach meets the real-time and high-accuracy requirements of master–slave mapping control for the Da Vinci surgical robots and other similar systems. In addition, the proposed approach can also serve as a design reference for other types of robotic arms that do not satisfy the Pieper principle.},

  abstract = {Robotic systems have become popular in modern surgical procedures. The option of telesurgery has effectively addressed geographic limitations. These systems are offered by numerous companies worldwide. In this review article, we discuss four models of robotic systems to determine their advantages: the Sina flex system from Iran and the da Vinci Xi, SP, and 5 systems from the USA. We compared aspects such as architecture, instruments, visualizations, clinical use, and costs. Our findings suggest that the da Vinci robot, which was introduced earlier than the Sina system, utilizes proprietary and limited-use EndoWrist instruments with diameters ranging from 8 to 12 mm and features advanced imaging capabilities, including three-dimensional optical, tomographic, and fluorescence imaging. It is well established and widely utilized in various surgical procedures. Conversely, the Sina flex system employs single-use 5 mm instruments and is equipped with two-dimensional optical imaging as a standard, with optional three-dimensional and fluorescence imaging upgrades available. Despite its affordability, the Sina flex system is relatively new and has not yet been clinically tested. Additionally, the Sina flex system is more user-friendly.}

In this review, we presented a model to help describe the PnP problems, and introduced two most common solutions. The P3P solution is the smallest subset of control points that yields a finite number of solutions. The EPnP solution is to reduce the complexity by expressing the n 3D points as a weighted sum of four virtual control points. The former solution is widely applied while there are 3 pairs of corresponding points in the problem. However, in most real cases, the latter is more used.}
