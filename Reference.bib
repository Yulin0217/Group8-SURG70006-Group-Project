  abstract = {Robotic systems have become popular in modern surgical procedures. The option of telesurgery has effectively addressed geographic limitations. These systems are offered by numerous companies worldwide. In this review article, we discuss four models of robotic systems to determine their advantages: the Sina flex system from Iran and the da Vinci Xi, SP, and 5 systems from the USA. We compared aspects such as architecture, instruments, visualizations, clinical use, and costs. Our findings suggest that the da Vinci robot, which was introduced earlier than the Sina system, utilizes proprietary and limited-use EndoWrist instruments with diameters ranging from 8 to 12 mm and features advanced imaging capabilities, including three-dimensional optical, tomographic, and fluorescence imaging. It is well established and widely utilized in various surgical procedures. Conversely, the Sina flex system employs single-use 5 mm instruments and is equipped with two-dimensional optical imaging as a standard, with optional three-dimensional and fluorescence imaging upgrades available. Despite its affordability, the Sina flex system is relatively new and has not yet been clinically tested. Additionally, the Sina flex system is more user-friendly.}
